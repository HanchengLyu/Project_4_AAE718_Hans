# Biogas Generation Modeling with Livestock Digester Data

This project analyzes how various factors influence biogas production in livestock-based anaerobic digestion systems using a public dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehmetisik/livestock-anaerobic-digester-database). The core objective is to identify the key drivers of biogas generation through multiple regression models.

## Project Structure

- `Project04.py`: Main analysis script for data cleaning, regression modeling, and visualization.
- `Project04.md`: Report discussing motivation, methodology, results, and implications.

## How to Run

1. **Download the dataset** from Kaggle manually: [Livestock Anaerobic Digester Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehmetisik/livestock-anaerobic-digester-database) and save it into a `data/` folder.
2. **Update `file_path` and `save_path`** in `Project04.py` to match your directory structure.
3. Run the script using Python 3:
   ```bash
   python Project04.py
